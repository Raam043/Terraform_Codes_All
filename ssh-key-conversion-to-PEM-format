The solution was to create a RSA private key using the command
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Example
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f monitoring

# This will convert your public key to an OpenSSL compatible format. Your private key is already in PEM format and can be used as is (as Michael Hampton stated).
Double check if AWS isn't asking for a (X.509) certificate in PEM format, which would be a different thing than your SSH keys.

# Example
ssh-keygen -f id_rsa -e -m pem

# Complete Steps
----------------
ssh-keygen -f rabbitmq
ssh-keygen -f rabbitmq -e -m pem
mv rabbitmq rabbitq.pem
