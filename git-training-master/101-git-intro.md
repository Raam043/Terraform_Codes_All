# What is Git ?
Most commonly used version control system today and some how the standard for version control

## Distribited vs. Centralized:

Git is a distributed version control system, it means your local copy code is a complete version control repository !

You work on your code localy (commit) and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on the server.

In centralized version control you must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of code !
