# What is version control?

Version control systems are software that help you track changes you make in your code over time. 
As you edit to your code, you tell the version control system to take a snapshot of your files. 
The version control system saves that snapshot permanently so you can recall it later if you need it.

Without version control, you’re tempted to keep multiple copies of code on your computer. 
This is dangerous-it’s easy to change or delete a file in the wrong copy of code, 
potentially losing work. Version control systems solve this problem by managing all versions of your code but 
presenting you with a single version at a time.

It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

Benefits:

    Create workflows
    Work with versions
    Code Together
    Keep a history
    Automate tasks


## Why open source practices and principles matter ?

[Because none of us is smarter than all of us](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/virtual-machines/linux/
)

### You can even see Enterprise organizations are using it !

[Look at Microsoft Account in github ](https://github.com/microsoft/
)

[Talke a look at Octoverse website](https://octoverse.github.com/)

##  What is InnerSource ?

InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. As developers have become accustomed to working on world class open source software, there is a strong desire to bring those practices back inside the firewall and apply them to software that companies may be reluctant to release
