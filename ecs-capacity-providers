Well as always, as soon as I ask someone else a question I solve it myself...

The issue was that I had AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy's assigned to my ASG. The ECS docs make it clear that this isn't allowed, removing the policies allowed the stack to deploy!


# Make sure to use ECS Capacity providers no MANAGED AS Policy is assigned to ASG
