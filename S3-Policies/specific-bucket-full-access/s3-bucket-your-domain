S3 CNAMEs require the bucket name to match the host name. If you want S3 to serve from imgs.langpai.me, you need to create a bucket named imgs.langpai.me. See the S3 documentation for more.

You could create a CloudFront distribution to answer to imgs.langpai.me (see CloudFront CNAME support) have it and forward requests to langpai.s3.amazonaws.com. This would, of course, also incur CloudFront charges.
